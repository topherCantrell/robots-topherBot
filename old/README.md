# Topher Bot

I added a 20-pixel neopixel strip to the front of the car for a K.I.T.T. (Knight Rider) effect.

TODO Next:
  - I'm not sure I need two spin files for the single board. Simplify.
  - Add some code in Main.spin to move the wheels.

## Hardware: Pi + MotorController

You can run the motor controller right off the PiZero -- no propeller board needed. The wiring looks
like this:

Remember to make the solder jumper on the shield for 3.3V power input.

The `python` folder has the `py_only.py` code. There are no frills in the code. I wanted to
keep it as minimal as possible.

## Hardware: Everything

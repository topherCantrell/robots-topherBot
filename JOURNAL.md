I am waiting for the cool, new pico based robot controller to get here. Meanwhile, I can plan the
physical layout and write the compass-reading routines. No need to pull in all of adafruit for that.

I don't like the robot base power switch right in the middle of the board. I super-glued it to the 
side of the battery pack instead. There are definitely better switch solutions, but since this is
for an article, I want to use as much of the simplistic original as possible.

I seem to be reading the compass, but I'm not making sense of the axis orientation. It doesn't seem to
be what's on the silk screen. I'll try with the official adafruit library too.
